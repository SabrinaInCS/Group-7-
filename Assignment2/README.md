## Design and Development Methodology
Our design and development methodology has changed since Assignment 1. 

## Front-End Technologies and Responsibilities
We are using the following front-end technologies:
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- why we choose HTML: HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure of the webpage by using elements such as headings, paragraphs, forms and buttons. Here are reasons we consider for using HTML in our Front-End development. First of all, it is for all modern browsers and is widely supported and compatible. The wbd pages written in HTML can display correctly across various devices and browsers. Second, HTML can be seamlessly combined with other technologies, like CSS and JavaScript to provide rich web functionalities and styles.Third, HTML intergrates seamlessly with many modern development tools and frameworks like React, Angular, ect. Fourth, HTML is relatively simple and esay to learn and there are a lot of learning materials on the internet, and there are a lot of templates to refer to. We can use it more quickly for our project. To sum up, We think HTML is the best choice and HTML will help us execute subsequent stage of design and development better.

- **CSS**: For styling the components.

Team responsibilities:
- **Sulton  Adedokun**: Creating and maintaining HTML and CSS styles.
